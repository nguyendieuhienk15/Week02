This will trigger a rich notification that is bridged over to the Wear device.
\n\nNote that the first time this runs it can take 20-30 seconds to transfer
the image data (in practice, users wouldn\'t notice this as the notification
would be triggered automatically and only show up after the data was
transferred).

This will trigger a notification on Wear that lets you open up the full
wearable app. A few things to note:\n\n
• Ensure you have the wearable APK installed on your Wear device (debug builds
require you to install it manually)\n\n
• The first time this runs it can take 20-30 seconds to transfer the image
data (in practice, users wouldn\'t notice this as the notification would only
be triggered after the data was transferred)\n\n
• The notification priority is set to the recommended default value so it may
appear further down your stream

    <string name="lorem">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>
